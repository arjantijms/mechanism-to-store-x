/**
 * <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> is a mechanism for obtaining a caller's
 * credentials in some way, using the HTTP protocol where necessary.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is used to help in securing Servlet endpoints, including
 * endpoints that may be build on top of Servlet like JAX-RS endpoints and JSF views.
 * It specifically <b>is not</b> used for endpoints such as remote EJB beans or (JMS) message driven beans.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <code>HttpAuthenticationMechanism</code> is essentially a Servlet specific and CDI enabled version of
 * the {@link ServerAuthModule} that adheres to the Server Container Profile. See the JASPIC spec for further
 * details on this.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class can notify the Servlet container about a succesful authentication by using the
 * {@link HttpMessageContext#notifyContainerAboutLogin(javax.security.CallerPrincipal, java.util.List)} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations are expected and encouraged to delegate the actual credential validation and/or retrieval of the
 * caller name with optional groups to an {@link IdentityStore}. This is however <b>not</b> required and implementations
 * can either do the validation checks for authentication completely autonomously, or delegate only certain aspects of
 * the process to the store (e.g. use the store only for retrieving the groups an authenticated user is in).
