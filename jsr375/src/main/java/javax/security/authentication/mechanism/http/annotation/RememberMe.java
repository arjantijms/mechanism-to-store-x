/**
 * The RememberMe annotation provides an application the ability to declarative designate 
 * that an {@link AuthenticationMechanism} "remembers" the authentication and auto
 * applies this with every request.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The location where this authentication is remembered has to be set by enabling a bean in
 * the application that implements the {@link RememberMeIdentityStore} interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the remember me function the credentials provided by the caller are exchanged for a token
 * which is send to the user as the value of a cookie, in a similar way to how the HTTP session ID is send.
 * It should be realized that this token effectively becomes the credential to establish the caller's
 * identity within the application and care should be taken to handle and store the token securely. E.g.
 * by using this feature with a secure transport (SSL/https), storing a strong hash instead of the actual
 * token, and implementing an expiration policy. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * This support is provided via an implementation of an interceptor spec interceptor that conducts the
 * necessary logic.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     {@literal @}RequestScoped
 *     {@literal @}RememberMe
 *     public class CustomAuthenticationMechanism implements HttpAuthenticationMechanism {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * </code>
